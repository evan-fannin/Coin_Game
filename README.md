# Coin_Game
This program assumes two players are playing a game where one scores a point by flipping a coin, say one player is heads and the other tails.
The program calculates the expected value of a $20 pool of prize money that should be given to each player, based
on their current scores.

For example, player A might have 2 points while player B has 3 points, and the points needed to win the game are 5.
The program calculates the probability that A will win and the probability that B will win, and then divides the 
prize money by these shares, without needing to finish the game.
